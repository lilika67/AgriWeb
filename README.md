# AgriWeb
This is a README file for  the Agricultural Marketplace app. This Python program will create an online platform that connects farmers with buyers, allowing them to sell their produce directly to consumers or businesses. The marketplace eliminates intermediaries, empowering farmers to reach a broader customer base and retain a higher percentage of their profits. The platform will feature product listings, search filters, secure payment processing, and a user-friendly interface.
This app is a menu driven application
